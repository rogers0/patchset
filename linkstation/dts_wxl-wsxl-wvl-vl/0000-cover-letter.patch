Here's the dts-patch support for 2 series of NAS products from Buffalo.

  kirkwood-lswxl.dtsi to support:
    - http://buffalo.jp/product/hdd/network/ls-wxl_r1/
    - http://buffalo.jp/products/catalog/storage/ls-wsxl_r1/

  kirkwood-lswvl.dtsi to support:
    - http://buffalo.jp/product/hdd/network/ls-wvl_r1/
    - http://buffalo.jp/product/hdd/network/ls-vl/

I have tested the patches againt latest next/dt branch (commit: 
1647e3c73ce54fc32536bb3a834eccad39b23572) and found they're booting and working 
fine on the real Buffalo NAS boxes.

These two dts patches are encouraged and reviewed by Iwamatsu-san from Debian 
project. Here I'd like to appreciate his kindness help. 

Since I'm merely a newbie contributor to kernel, if there's any mistake or 
something need to be adjusted, please just let know.

It'd be great if you could consider to merge the patches. Thank you!
